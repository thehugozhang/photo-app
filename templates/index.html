<!-- 

    Adding a feature for users to easily add alt-text to their image.

    Since alt-text should only be displayed when the image fails to load,
    I would add a feature that asks users specifically for the alt-text
    they'd like to use to describe the image they are uploading. This
    feature would look similar to a text input that would save their
    reponse in a backend database value. Then, through either JavaScript
    or in my code somewhere, I would dynamically assign the alt attribute
    of the image tag <img> corresponding to their uploaded photo to their
    submitted alt-text value.
